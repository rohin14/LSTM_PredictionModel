Apple Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM Model
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting Apple stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model leverages historical stock price data and calculates two key metrics: MAE100 (100-day Moving Average) and MAE200 (200-day Moving Average) to assess and compare the stock price trends.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess historical stock price data.
LSTM Model: Build and train an LSTM model for time series prediction.
Moving Averages Calculation: Calculate MAE100 and MAE200 to provide a smoothed view of stock price trends.
Visualization: Plot the predicted vs. actual stock prices along with the moving averages.
Requirements
